# Project-with-Plus10

Plus10 is a manufacturing company based in Augsburg, Bayern and Stuttgart, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg.

The Project is divided into 2 parts: 

1. Prediction of Bearing Life-Cycle stage using KMeans, SVM: Design of disturbance behavior of a fully automated production line by developing a classification model. Application of machine learning, scikit-learn and statistical algorithms through Python with Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

2. RUL Calculation of a Bearing with SVR Algorithm. Performed Data Mining, Wavelet Transformation, Normalisation, PCA: Calculation of Remaining Useful Life of a machine component from drill-down to wear. Application of Machine Learning through Python and Scikit-learn.
